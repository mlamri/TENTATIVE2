video : size (megabyte)
put in 0 or several cache servers

cache server : max capacity

endpoints : every E is connecter to DC

Input DATASET : ASCII characters '\n' EOL

V, E, C = integers IDs from 0 to E/V/C -1 

first line
V (1<=V<=10000)
E (1<=E<= 1000)
R (1<=R<=1000000) : number of requests
C (1<=C<=1000) 
X (1<=X<=500000) : capacity of each CS in megabytes

second line : sizes of individual videos in megabytes S0, S1, ... Sv-1

Ld : (2<=Ld<=4000) : latecy of serving video request DC - E
K : (O<=K<=C) : number of CS E in connected to
c : (0<=c<)C) : ID of CS

Lc (1<=Lc<=500) : latency serving video request from CS - E (milliseconds)
1<=Lc<Ld

Rv = ID of requested video
Re = ID of endpoint from which request are coming from
Rn = number of requests
